The imaging parameters include the number of voxels, voxel size, precision, viewing distance, number of inplanes, atom radii, atom selection, and whether to use the default protein residue model for the atomic radii for each amino acid type.
Currently, the user is advised to make sure the number of voxels and voxel size agrees with the cryo-EM data to avoid inconsistent results.
The atomic radii and atom selection are optional. If the user does not specify the atomic radii, the function will use the default atomic radii for each amino acid type.
If the user does not specify the atom selection, the function will use all atoms in the atomic model.
