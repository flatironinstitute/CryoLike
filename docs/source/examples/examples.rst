Examples
==========================

These pages provide basic examples of the CryoLike
functions and the use cases it can handle. They intentionally
do not cover a wide array of possible use cases--more detailed
information can be found in both the :doc:`/tutorials/tutorials`
section and the :doc:`API documentation </pythonapi/modules>`.

These examples are distributed with the source code under the
``src/example`` directory, and should work on every installation.
Running through them
is a good way to confirm that your system is set up properly.
