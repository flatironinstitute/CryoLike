Full cryoLike pipeline from models and images to Likelihood matrix
##########################################################

Overview
==========
Below we describe all steps to go from a set of structures and images to obatin cryoLike likehood matrix. 

We assume that the user has set a python environment with all the dependencies and that ``python3`` is associated with it

Set Parameters
==========


Make Templates 
==========



Convert Images 
==========



Run Likelihood 
==========



Collect Likelihood Matrix
==========


Further Analysis 
==========

- compute log likelihood rotatio
- computes weights with ensemble reweighting
