Starting from cryoSPARC file formats
========================================================

In this tutorial, we will show how to read cryo-EM data from cryoSPARC files into CryoLike.

.. What is our format? 

.. Example of specification for file format: We read the .cs file format to look for file references to the image data...
.. The file references should be in relative paths for .cs files, that's how cryosparc handle files in the project folder
.. Have the user check if the file are in the correct location
